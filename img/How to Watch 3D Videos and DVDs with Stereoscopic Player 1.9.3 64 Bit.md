The answer is yes, thanks to Stereoscopic Player 1.9.3 64 Bit, a versatile 3D movie player that allows you to play stereoÂ­scopic videos and DVDs (external decoder required) and also allows you to watch live video from a capture device.

But what makes Stereoscopic Player 1.9.3 64 Bit stand out from other 3D movie players is that it can convert any stereoÂ­scopic video to the desired output format in real-time.

Stereoscopic Player 1.9.3 64 Bit will do the rest and display the movie in 3D on your PC.
 
But that's not all. Stereoscopic Player 1.9.3 64 Bit also has some advanced features for professional use, such as command line parameters, OLE automation and the Sony 9-pin protocol to automate the player. Furthermore, it can control external effects via a serial port or DMX512.
